    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <h2>What is personality?</h2>
    <p>
      Personality refers to individual differences in thinking, feeling, and
      behaving that are relatively stable over a long period of time and remain
      <b> consistent across different environments and situations</b>
      (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
    </p>
    <h2>Why should we care about personality?</h2>
    <p>
      Discussions of personality can be traced back to the Tremendous
      Theophrastus in the good old days of 319 BC, “Often before now have I
      applied my thoughts to the puzzling questions – why it is that, while all
      Greece lies under the same sky and all the Greeks are educated alike, It
      has befallen us to have characters so variously constituted”. Whether it
      be over tea and biscuits with friends or catching up on the latest gossip
      in the lunchroom, we have probably all attempted to describe our own or
      another person's fundamental tendencies. We are social animals that are
      motivated to understand how we are like all people, like some people, or
      like no other person, Murray, and Kluckhohn (1953).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our personality traits can predict real world outcomes to known levels of
      accuracy in domains like academic success, job performance and romantic
      relationships success. Further, in a world dominated with modern gizmos
      and gadgets, you may have heard a phrase like Tik Tok knows me too well”
      our digital footprint is packed with juicy information that computer
      algorithms use to profile our personality. This information is often used
      to tailor services and fine tune recommendation engines to serve us
      bullseye hit content. Example: Someone who is particularly agreeable can
      be identified 64.5% of the time through their behaviours on social media,
      tell-tale behaviours include higher expression of positive emotions in
      their posts posting and limited to no use of profanity in their posts
      (Schwartz et al., 2013). Even if you don’t post much, people high in
      conscientiousness on average appear to be more cautious in managing their
      social media profiles, post fewer pictures and express less likes,
      (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010).
    </p>

    <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
    <p>
      Personality traits are often used as the descriptive unit of personality.
      In psychology a personality trait is quite specific and must follow a few
      rules (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).

      <h2>Hypothetical example</h2>
      <p>
        Frankfurt’s has just starting playing tennis his new peers describe him
        as sociable because his mouth does a lot of flapping. Frankfurt also
        frequents church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend bird
        watching seminars. However, Frankfurt is much quieter and reserved at
        church and bird watching. Because this talkativeness is restricted to
        the tennis club, it reflects both situational exclusivity and there is
        not enough evidence regarding stability over a period of time, as Frank
        has only just started playing tennis.

      <h2>Part 2</h2>
      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>
        No.I would be unsuprised if you have taken something like the
        Myers-Briggs Nonsense Test (MBTI), an inventory that outputs your
        personality type like ‘INTJ’ or ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBTI, I
        would suggest tossing in into the loo
        <span class="toilet-icon">&#128701;</span>
        and be sure to use the
        <b>FULL FLUSH</b> setting, not the half flush setting. Personally I
        would ensure my bladder is emptied prior to flushing, but i'll leave
        that up to your own personal autonomy.

        alt="myers briggs down the toilet bowl"
        class="img"
      />

      The psychological literature provides evidence for "individuals differing
      from one another by degrees rather than belonging to discrete categories
      (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).

      <h2>BIG 5 (OCEAN) <span class="hundred">💯</span></h2>
      <p>
        The BIG 5 is a hierarchy of traits that covers breadth regarding
        individual differences and gives trait terms a structured organisation.
        The 5 fundamental High-Level Traits broadly describe the 5 core domains
        of individual differences, as the hierarchy is traversed the personality
        traits become more specific in definition, eventually arriving at the
        final destination of some observable behaviour. it is more common for
        people to use the mid level traits in general conversation, that is
        because if someone is described to be neurotic, the next question would
        probably be how so? A mid-level trait would probably be used to privide
        a more specific definintion associated with more specific observable
        behaviours that could be put on display.

      <h2>How did we get to the BIG 5 (OCEAN)</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/bigtimeline.png" alt="timeline" class="img" />

      <h2>Amazing Allport and Outstanding Odbert</h2>
      <img

        alt="allportodbert"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>You may be wondering how is this better than types? I am glad you ask 
        the BIG 5 has been in development since 1936 and is a result using 
        methods like statistical reduction. 



        Allport & Odbert kickbelieved that anything of value or important enough to
        a society is encoded in language. In 1936 the boys took a New
        International Dictionary in search of an extensive list of possible
        adjectives that could be used to describe individual differences. The
        criteria to make it on there list was as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describes broad ways in which people can be different</li>
        <li>Describes temporary moods or activities.</li>
        <li>Describes social or character judgements of personal conduct.</li>
        <li>
          Describes of physique, mental capacities and developmental conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Out popped the small list of 17,953 traits like impulisive, methodical and
      sociable + another 17,950 of a similar tune.

      <h2>Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        Like Allport & Odbert, Cattell supported the lexical hypothesis, but
        also hypothesised that personality traits correlate with real world
        outcomes. he was able to reduce Allports & Odberts list of 17, 953 trait
        into 16 fundamental personality factors using statistical methods like
        clustering and factor analysis.
      </p>

      <h2>Legendary Lewis R. Goldberg</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/lewis.png" alt="lewis" class="img" />
      <p>
        Goldy in 1993 published "An alternative description of personality: The
        Big-Five factor structure" research showed across decades of psychology
        research the BIG 5 personality factors constantly emerged, with the
        above studies being landmark findings of the time. The BIG 5 factors
        also holds up across cultures, with some minor differences culturally
        specific factors sometimes emerge e.g. using the same appraoch 'Harmony'
        arises in Chinese. But fundamentally the BIG 5 holds up acorss cultures.
      </p>

      <h2>Standardised Inventories</h2>
      MMPI Norm refering your results are compared against a much larger
      representative distribution of other people who have also taken the MMPI.
      Plotting your results onto a normal distribution, The 2 standard deviation
      rule is commonly used, if you differ by 2 standard deviations on some
      trait x this would mean you display behaviours associated with a trait
      signficantly differently than most other people. for MMPI reliability and
      validity metrics https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9443642/

      <p>
        Anyhow that is all I have for today all the best and I hope you have a
        FANTASTIC WEEK ahead, working towards you goals dreams and aspirations.
