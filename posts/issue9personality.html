        <h2>What is personality? <span>🎭</span></h2>
        <p>
          Personality describes stable patterns of thinking, feeling, and
          behaving that remain relatively constant
          <b
            >across different environments, situations and over an extended
            period of time</b
          >, often spanning years and/or decades (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
        </p>

        <h2>Why care about personality?</h2>

        <h4>Social Creatures <span>🗣️</span></h4>
        <p>
          Discussions around personality can be traced back to the old days of
          319 BC to the tremendous Theophrastus, “Often before now have I
          applied my thoughts to the puzzling questions – why it is that, while
          all Greece lies under the same sky and all the Greeks are educated
          alike, it has befallen us to have characters so variously
          constituted”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it's over tea and biscuits with friends or lunchroom goss, we
          are social animals that are motivated to understand how we are like
          all people, like some people, or like no other person (Murray, and
          Kluckhohn, 1953).
        </p>

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <p>
          Personality traits are adjectives that describe individual
          differences. In psychology a personality trait has a specific meaning
          (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).

        <h3>Personality predicts real world outcomes! <span>🔮</span></h3>
        <p>
          Studies have shown that personality traits correlate with real-world
          outcomes. For example, being above average on a trait x is associated
          with also being above average in some related real world outcome,
          these outcomes go to the tune of academic success and job performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In today's modern world of gizmos and gadgets, it is not uncommon to
          hear phrases like "Instagram knows me too well”. Our behavioural
          patterns on social media create digital footprints that are used to
          profile our personalities. Because personality has predictive value 
          companies are able to tailor services
          and content to our liking.
        </p>

          alt="personality traits"
          class="img"
        />
        <p>
          For example, ~70% of people who are above average in extroversion are
          also above average in behaviours such as higher levels of activity on
          a chosen platform and having a greater number of friends in their
          network (Blackwell et al., 2017). Similarly, ~68% of people who are
          above average on the trait conscientiousness tend to be above average
          in associated displays, including cautious management of their
          profiles, posting less and expressing fewer likes on other people's
          posts (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010).

        <b>Hypothetical example and common mishap:</b> Franklin has just started
        playing tennis; his new peers describe him as sociable because his mouth
        does a lot of flapping. Franklin also frequents the church for gospel
        studies and the countryside to attend bird-watching seminars. However,
        Franklin is much quieter and far more reserved during his time at church
        and bird watching seminars. Because his talkativeness is observed only
        at the tennis club, it reflects situational exclusivity. If you only
        knew Franklin at tennis, it would not be accurate to assign him the
        label of highly extroverted. Because it does not reflect behavioural
        tendencies across environments, situations or across time for that
        matter.

      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>No.</p>
      <h2>Myers-Briggs Nonsense Inventory</h2>
      It would not suprise me if you have taken something like the Myers-Briggs
      Nonsense Test (MBTI), an inventory outputs your personality type like
      ‘INTJ’ or ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBTI, I would suggest washing it
      down the loo and be sure to use the <b>FULL FLUSH</b>, not the half flush
      setting, very important. Personally, I would ensure my bladder was emptied
      prior to flushing.

      <em>Figure: Myers Briggs Test Inventory</em>
      <img

        alt="myers briggs down the toilet bowl"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        If you are like me and have spent your spare time wondering how such
        waffle has turned into a US$2 billion personality assessment industry
        (Manne, 2014). A good starting point would be to investigate the
        authors, Katherine and Isobel Briggs, and the material that formed the
        basis of their ideas. Neither of the Briggs duo had formal training in
        psychology or psychiatry; Katherine Briggs earned a college degree in
        agriculture in 1893, and her daughter Isobel graduated from drama school
        in 1919. The Briggs pair dabbled in psychology during their spare time.
        Katherine was infatuated by the work of the <b>LEGENDARY Carl Jung</b>,
        but also seemingly Carl Jung himself, writing poems and songs that
        declared his greatness.
      </p>

      <em>Figure: The Briggs duo and Carl Jung</em>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/briggsjung.png"
        alt="briggslovesjung"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Carl Jung made many lasting and influencial contributions to psychology,
        but his theory on personality types has been tossed in the garbage bin
        by the academic community. When Jung himself is put under the
        microscope, it is clear that his formative years provide some
        explanation for his thinking around rigid personality types. A
        theorist's work is rarely uninfluenced by their own personality and life
        experiences (Wrightsman, 1994).
      </p>

      <img src="../assets/issue9/jungsit.png" alt="Carl himself" class="img" />

      <p>
        Jung often sorted the world into vast dichotomies, black or white,
        positive or negative. Rarely did he describe anything as possibly being
        neutral, in-between or a shade of grey. As a young chap he saw himself
        as having two distinct personalities: personality 1, which was known to
        his parents and others and personality 2, reserved for tending to vital
        matters such as studying the mysteries of the universe (Stolorow &
        Atwood, 1979. P.98).
      </p>
      <h2>Personality Types, plotting the data <span>❌</span></h2>
      <p>
        Evidence against personality types can be found through studying the
        masses of data produced by the survey results themself. If types
        existed, we would expect to see the data form bimodal distributions –
        distinct peaks that represent a personality type.
        <b>THIS IS NOT SEEN!</b>
      </p>

      <em
        >Figure: Hypothetical biomodal distribution representing personality
        types</em
      >

      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/biomodal.png"
        alt="biomodal camel"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        What can be observed are normal distributions. Where people express
        trait-related behaviours to varying degrees along a continuum, where
        most people fall within two standard deviations of the mean. A result
        landing outside of two standard deviations from the mean, would suggest
        a significant difference in comparison to a wider population.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to Franklin, he is on average more introverted than extroverted
        across situations, but he is not completely without extroversion‑related
        expression, he is sociable and talkative at the tennis club, the type
        system does not acknowledge this.
      </p>

      <em>Figure Franklins Hypothetical Extroversion Score</em>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/franklinextroversion.png"
        alt="frank extroversion"
        class="img"
      />

      <h2>Personality Types, Reliability and Validity <span>❌</span></h2>
      <p>
        Evidence against personality types can be found in the reliability and
        validity metrics of the inventories used measure them. For example, a
        key reliability metric is the test-retest reliability, in the case of
        the nonsense Briggs, one day it outputs bananas and the other day it can
        output oranges, what good is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we are interested in personality for its predictive value, it
        would be good to have some confidence in the MBTI predictive validity,
        and quite frankly the proper evidence must have been misplaced. . .
        There is a fair bit to reliability and validity, but I don’t want to put
        you to sleep. In short, the MBTI does not stack up to professional
        benchmarks. To end on a positive, I do commend Katherine and Isobel
        Briggs for their enthusiasm and go-getter spirit despite having no
        formal training, I did wonder with a bit of formal training they might
        have become hall of famers in the field.

        <h2>BIG 5 History<span>📜</span></h2>
        The BIG 5 has been in work since 1936, and is the result of massive
        amounts of research that uses statistical methods such as clustering and
        factor analysis over many large datasets and seminal works. The BIG 5
        evolved on the basis of the lexical hypothesis, the idea that anything
        of value or important enough to a society is given a word and encoded in
        language. Because language is dynamic (changes over time, as you might
        notice if you talk to a Gen Z) the BIG 5 model is subject to and should
        change with time.

        <em>Figure: BIG 5 timeline</em>

        <h3>Stop 1 - Amazing Allport and Outstanding Odbert</h3>
        <img
          src="../assets/issue9/allportodbert.png"
          alt="allportodbert"
          class="img"
        />
        <p>
          In 1936, Allport & Odbert dusted off a New International Dictionary
          and set out to extract all adjectives that could be used to describe
          individual differences. Their easter egg hunt resulted in a list of
          4,500 traits like impulsive, methodical, and sociable.
        </p>

        To make it onto their list, inclusion criteria was as follows:

        <ul>
          <li>Describes broad ways in which people can be different.</li>
          <li>Describes temporary moods or activities.</li>
          <li>Describes social or character judgments of personal conduct.</li>
          <li>
            Descriptions of physique, mental capacities, and developmental
            conditions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stop 2 - The Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h3>
        <img
          src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
          alt="raymond cattell"
          class="img"
        />

        <p>
          Cattell used Allport's and Odbert's list of 4500 trait terms and
          reduced them into 16 fundamental personality factors using statistical
          methods like semantic reduction and factor analysis. He published the
          16PF inventory, which boasts strong test-retest reliability, taking
          the test at time point one will yield highly stable results when
          compared to the same test taken again at later date. The 16PF comes
          with solid predictive validity. For example correlations with
          leadership effectiveness translate to ~60–68% of people scoring above
          average on leadership related traits also are above average in terms
          of leadership outcomes (Conn et ., 1994). This isn't perfect but it is
          still better than flipping a coin or leaving it up to complete
          subjective interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3>Stop 3 - Legendary Lewis R. Goldberg</h3>
        <img src="../assets/issue9/lewis.png" alt="lewis" class="img" />
        <p>
          Goldy in 1993 published "An alternative description of personality:
          The Big-Five factor structure" research showed across decades of
          psychology research the BIG FIVE personality factors constantly
          emerged and it was agreed upon in the academic literature. With this
          he officially named it the BIG FIVE.
        </p>

        <h2>Standardised Inventories</h2>
        Before wrapping it up, it wouldn't be right for me to soil on the
        Myers-Briggs Nonsense Inventory without providing alternatives. Common
        instruments include Cattell's 16PF, NEO-PI-3 and the MMPI, all have
        undergone decades of research and testing and boast solid reliability
        and validity metrics. Additionally, these tests have been completed by
        masses of people, meaning that your results are compared to the
        established norms. The MMPI, however, is reserved for qualified
        psychologists and psychiatrists because it is tailored for clinical
        assessment and high-risk occupational contexts. Some of its features
        include inbuilt mechanisms to catch fibsters, attempts to “fake good”
        and conversely “fake bad” , infrequent and random responses. For
        example, if someone has approached the questionnaire in a way that makes
        them appear more positive than they actually are because they are trying
        to get a job, the MMPI can identify this. Because all the survey items

        revealing a more accurate psychological profile of the person under
        test.

        Anyhow, that is all I have for today’s psychological thriller, I hope
        you have learnt something new and most importantly had a
        <b>THUMPING </b>time reading it, I have had a <b>THUMPING </b>time
        writing it. Unless you are an avid pupil and want to complete the
        <b>STEELE Inventory</b>, I wish you a <b>SPECTACTULAR</b> week ahead!
        All the best, <br /><b>STEELE</b>
