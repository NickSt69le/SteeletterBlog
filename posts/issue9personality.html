    <h2>What is personality?</h2>
    <p>
      Personality sets out to describe individual differences regarding patterns
      of thinking, feeling, and behaving that remain relatively constant
      <b
        >across different environments, situations and over an extended period
        of time </b
      >, often spanning years and decades. (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
    </p>

    <h2>Why should we care about personality?</h2>
    <h3>Social Creatures</h3>
    <p>
      Discussions around personality can be traced back to the old days of 319
      BC to the tremendous Theophrastus, “Often before now have I applied my
      thoughts to the puzzling questions – why it is that, while all Greece lies
      under the same sky and all the Greeks are educated alike, It has befallen
      us to have characters so variously constituted”.
    </p>

    <img src="../assets/issue9/potter.png" class="img" alt="potter" />

    <p>
      Whether it over tea and biscuits with friends or playground gossip we have
      all attempted to describe what either ourself or another person is
      generally like. We are social animals that are motivated to understand how
      we are like all people, like some people, or like no other person, Murray,
      and Kluckhohn (1953).
    </p>

    <h3>Personality predicts real world outcomes</h3>
    <p>
      It is worth studying personality because personality predicts real-world
      outcomes that matter including academic success, job performance and other
      important life outcomes with known accuracy. More specifically and
      especially in todays modern world of fandangle gizmos and gadgets, it is
      not uncommon to hear phrases like "TikTok knows me too well”, this is
      because the footprints we leave especially on social media, can be used to
      profile our personalities, often used for tailoring services and content
      right to our preferences, so that we stay glued and coming back for more.
    </p>
    <img

      alt="personality tratis"
      class="img"
    />
    <p>
      For example, our behavioural patterns on social media is used to infer our
      personalities. People high in extraversion can be distinguished with ~70%
      accuracy, characterised by behaviours like higher levels of activity and
      having a greater number of friends compared to most other people
      (Blackwell et al., 2017) . Individuals higher in the trait
      conscientiousness can be distinguished ~68% of the time characterised by
      behaviours such as cautious management of their profiles, posting less and
      expressing fewer likes on other peoples posts, (Amichai-Hamburger &
      Vinitzky, 2010),
      <i
        >mind you this study was published in 2010 I would imagine it has been
        improved since then.</i
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
    <p>
      Personality traits are commonly used to describe personality. In
      psychology a personality trait has a refined definition, (Haslam & Smilie,
      2022).

    <h2>Hypothetical example and common mishaps</h2>
    <article>
      Franklin has just started playing tennis; his new peers describe him as
      sociable because his mouth does a lot of flapping. Frankfurt also
      frequents church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend bird
      watching seminars. However, Frankfurt is much quieter and far more
      reserved during his time at church and bird watching seminars. Because his
      talkativeness is observed only at the tennis club; it reflects situational
      exclusivity. Further in this example, there is not enough evidence to
      conclude that this sociableness has been consistent over a long period of
      time.

      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>No.</p>

      <h2>Myers Briggs Nonsense Inventory</h2>
      I would be unsuprised if you have taken something like the Myers-Briggs
      Nonsense Test (MBTI), an inventory that when completed outputs your
      personality type like ‘INTJ’ or ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBTI, I
      would suggest tossing it into the loo and be sure to use the
      <b>FULL FLUSH</b> setting, not the half flush setting. Personally, I would
      ensure my bladder was emptied prior to flushing
      <span class="toilet-icon">&#128701;</span>. I also almost fell sideways
      when the Myers Briggs wesbite told me I would have to flush 85 AUD down
      the toilet to get told my personality type.

        alt="myers briggs down the toilet bowl"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        If you are like me and have spent your spare time wondering how such
        waffle has turned into a US$2 billion personality assessment industry
        (Manne, 2014). A good starting point would be to investigate the authors
        Katherine and Isobel Briggs and the material that formed the basis of
        their ideas. who started working on it in the 1940s. Neither Katherine
        or Isobel had formal training in psycholgy or psychiatry, Katherine
        Briggs earned a college degree in agriculture and her daughter Isobel
        was educated in drama. The Briggs dabbled in pscyhology during their
        spare time and specifically Katherine was infatuated by the
        <b>LEGENDARY Carl Jung</b>, but also seemingly Carl Jung himself,
        publishing poems and songs which declared his greatness.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/briggsjung.png"
        alt="briggslovesjung"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Carl Jung made many amazing contributions to psychology, but his theory
        on personality types has been tossed in the garbage tin by the
        professional academic community. When Jung himself is put under the
        microscope, we can understand how his past experiences shaped his view
        of personality types. A theorist's work is rarely uninfluenced by their
        own personality and life experiences (Wrightsman, 1994). Jung often
        sorted the world into vast dichotomies, that is, black or white,
        positive or negative. Rarely did he describe any shade of grey . . . As
        a young chap, Jung saw himself as having two distinct personalities,
        personality 1, which he believed was known to his parents and others and
        personality 2, reserved for when he was attending to vital matters such
        as studying the mysteries of the universe” (Stolorow & Atwood, 1979.
        P.98). 
        </p>
        <p>
        To quickly diverge, Jungs mentor who many would know, the
        <b>SENSATIONAL Sigman Freud </b> also illustrates how personality and
        previous life experiences can flavour someones view of the world.
        Freud's theory on psychosexual development revolves aroud the core idea
        that people are primarily motivated to peruse biological reward. When
        considering Freud's previous education and work experience as a
        biologist, his decision to approach personality development from a
        biological perspective makes a whole lot of sense. With all of this, it
        is clear that the MBTI is built upon straw and not solid stone.
      </p>
      <h2>Further evidence against personality types</h2>
      <p>
        If personality were a type research the results of personality
        measurement would produce a biomodal distribution, where people are
        either introvered or extraverted and not inbetween.
        <img
          src="../assets/issue9/biomodal.png"
          alt="biomodal camel"
          class="img"
        />
        This is not seen, what is seen in the data is people expressing a trait
        to a degree of difference along a continuum, where most peoples
        association to a trait falls around the central tendency. In Franklins
        case:
        <img
          src="../assets/issue9/frankextroversion.png"
          class="img"
          alt="fanklin"
        />

        Frankfort might on average express more behaviours associated with
        introversion, when compared to a population of other people. Another
        disadvantage of the personality type theory is that their exist
        longitudinal studies that have shown that irrifutable evidence
        personality can change over a period of years and decades, however using
        the type system, the bucket you are assigned is what you get.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evidence against personality types can also be found in the reliability
        and validity metrics of the inventories that measure them. For example,
        a key realiability metric is the test-retest reliability, in the case of
        the nonsense briggs, on one day its spits out oranges and taking another
        day can give you a bananas, what good is that. It would also be good to
        know something about what your personality type can predict in terms of
        real world outcomes through predictive validity, and quite frankly not a
        whole lot. There is a lot more regarding reliability and validity
        metrics, but I hope to keep you awake, in short the MBTI doesn't not
        come close meeting realiability and validity benchmarks for professional
        psychology. Ending on a positive note I commend both them for their
        enthusiasm and hard work, I imagine with a bit of formal training and
        high level montoring they could have gone down as hall of famers.

    <h2>THE BIG 5 (OCEAN)🔥</h2>
    <p>
      The BIG 5 provides a structured heirachy of personality traits. The
      Highest level traits describe the five core domains of individual
      differences, people differ in their own unique levels of expression, like
      we saw in the example of FRANKLIN. The BIG 5 is a structured hierachy
      starting with the 5 fundamental high level traits and becomes more
      specific in definition, eventually arriving at the final destination of
      some observable behaviour. The BIG 5 is the result of a lot of academic
      that began in 1936 and used methods like statiscal clustering and factor
      analysis. it is more common for people to use the mid level traits in
      general conversation, e.g. if you describe someone as the high level trait
      of Neurotic, id imagine the next question might be, in what way? A mid
      level trait such as, Tense Timmy gives you a much better idea on what to
      expect.

      <h2>BIG 5 History<span>📜</span></h2>
      The BIG 5 has been in works since 1936, and is the result of massive
      amounts research that use methods such as clustering and factor analysis
      over relevant datasets. The BIG 5 has evolved from a bottom up approach
      and stands upon the basis of the lexical hypothesis, the idea that
      anything of value or important enough to a society is given a word and
      encoded in language.

        alt="allportodbert"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Upon a marvellous sunrise in 1936, Allport & Odbert dusted off their own
        personal New International Dictionary and set out to extract all
        adjectives that could be used to describe individual differences. To
        make in to their list, the adjective had to meet the following inclusion
        criteria:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describes broad ways in which people can be different</li>
        <li>Describes temporary moods or activities.</li>
        <li>Describes social or character judgements of personal conduct.</li>
        <li>
          Describes of physique, mental capacities and developmental conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Out popped the small list of 4500 traits like impulisive, methodical and
      sociable + another 4597.

      <h2>Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h2>

        src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        Like Allport & Odbert, Cattell supported the lexical hypothesis, but
        also hypothesised that personality traits correlate with real world
        outcomes. he was able to reduce Allports & Odberts list of 4500 trait
        into 16 fundamental personality factors using statistical methods like
        clustering and factor analysis. He invented the 16PF inventory which
        boasts strong test-retest realiability - similar scores about 85–94%
        over test taken 2 weeks apart. Studies like have shown it to be able to
        spo Based on predictive‑validity coefficients in thethe 16PF identifies
        leadership‑related abilities about 60–68% of the time (Conn, S. R., &
        Rieke, M. L. (1994)., which isn't perfect but it much better than
        flipping a coin.

      <h2>Legendary Lewis R. Goldberg</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/lewis.png" alt="lewis" class="img" />
      <p>

        Big-Five factor structure" research showed across decades of psychology
        research the BIG 5 personality factors constantly emerged, with the
        above studies being landmark findings of the time. The BIG 5 factors
        also holds up across cultures, with some minor differences culturally
        specific factors sometimes emerge e.g. using the same appraoch 'Harmony'

      <h2>Standardised Inventories</h2>

      Before wrapping it up, it wouldn't be right for me to soil on the Myers
      Briggs Nonsense Inventory without providing some far far more realiable
      and valid alternatives. THe following inventorie have undergone decades of
      research and testing and many come with built in mechanisms that catch out
      like fibsters, people faking to be better than they are, people faking to
      be worse than they are, infrequent respding and random responding. ALso
      because all questions on these surey are statistically related to one
      another if someone has approached the entire survey in a particualr way
      e.g trying to fake bad, a correction can be applied which would reveal a
      more accurate representation of them. As touched on Raymond Cattells 16PF
      boasts solid reliability and validity. NEO Personality Inventory NEO-PI-R
      is also famously used, and the MMPI is excellent but only used by
      professional pshychologist and psyciatrists because of its puse case which
      relates to clinical and screenings for high risk/ extreme environment
      related work. These inventories are built on the dimensional approach to
      personality. Another major benifit is a lot of people have completed them.
      Meaning that upon completion, your results are compared to a a massive
      data pool of other peoples results which form a normal distribution, this
      allows you or the test administrator to understand where somoone sits
      regarding some traits x in comparison to most other people. Results
      landing anywhere beyond 2 standard deviations away from the central
      tendency would be considered a consierable difference to most other
      people.

      It is nice to know I am a little less bananas when compared to a large
      sample of other Australians.

    Before wrapping it up, inventories are just one way of measuring personality
    there are a lot of other ways, they are just popular and can give you
    answers quickly and relitively cheaply.It is always good to keep in mind
    inventories are self-report and self-report evidence should form part of the
    evidence which contributes to a broader picture.
