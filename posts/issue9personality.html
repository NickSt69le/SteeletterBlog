        <h2>What is personality?</h2>
        <p>
          Personality refers to individual differences in thinking, feeling, and
          behaving that remain relatively stable over an extended period of time
          and are
          <b> consistent across different environments and situations</b>,
          (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
        </p>
        <h2>Why should we be fussed about personality?</h2>
        <p>
          Discussion around personality dominate our daily conversations and
          done so since 319 BC in which the tremendous Theophrastus pondered
          “Often before now have I applied my thoughts to the puzzling questions
          – why it is that , while all Greece lies under the same sky and all
          the Greeks are educated alike, It has befallen us to have characters
          so variously constituted”. Whether it be over tea and biscuits with
          friends or catching up on the latest gossip with work colleagues in
          the lunchroom, we have probably all attempted to describe our own or
          another person's fundamental tendencies. We are social animals that
          are motivated to understand how we are like all people, like some
          people, or like no other person, Murray, and Kluckhohn (1953).
        </p>

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <p>
          Personality traits are often used as the descriptive unit of
          personality. In psychology a personality trait is quite specific and
          must meet a few rules.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Psychological not physical: Refers to psychological phenomena, e.g.
            kind not tall.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enduring not transient: Refers to an enduring trait consistent
            across time and situation, and not a fleeting emotion. e.g. warm not
            sad.
          </li>
          <li>
            Broad not specific: Broadly describes behaviours across a number of
            situations. E.g. Disciplined not pizza lover.
          </li>
        </ul>

        So what are some valid personality traits?
        <ul>

        <h2>Describing personality, a common mishap.</h2>
        <p>
          Frankfurt’s tennis peers describe him as sociable because his mouth
          does triple the amount of flapping at the tennis club. Frankfurt also
          frequents church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend bird
          watching tours but is much quieter and reserved at church and
          birdwatching. Because this talkativeness appears only around the
          tennis club, it reflects situational exclusivity and does not hold up
          to the across-environments test. Therefore, if Frankfurt’s tennis
          friends knew him only at tennis, describing Frankfurt as extroverted
          would not be an average representation regarding how he behaves across
          environments and situations. Frankfurts behaviour at tennis highlights
          the power of the situation, which greatly influences our behaviour.
          Through environmental conditioning we learn to automatically react to
          cues from the environment, helping us to become efficient agents of
          our environments and save ourselves some cognitive energy to use on
          something else as we are all managing a limit energy budget. Example,
          when you see a green traffic light, you most likely don’t put too much
          though into putting your pedal to the metal, rather it is an automatic
          reflex that is associated with the positive outcome of getting to work
          on time. Because of this, our behaviour is often highly environmental
          or situation specific.
