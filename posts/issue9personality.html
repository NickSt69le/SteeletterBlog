    <h2>What is personality?</h2>
    <p>
      Personality describes stable patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving
      that remain relatively constant
      <b
        >across different environments, situations and over an extended period
        of time</b
      >, often spanning years and decades, (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
    </p>

    <h2>Why care about personality?</h2>
    <h4>Social Creatures <span>🗣️</span></h4>
    <p>
      Discussions around personality can be traced back to the old days of 319
      BC to the tremendous Theophrastus, “Often before now have I applied my
      thoughts to the puzzling questions – why it is that, while all Greece lies
      under the same sky and all the Greeks are educated alike, it has befallen
      us to have characters so variously constituted”.
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/issue9/potter.png" class="img" alt="potter" />
    <p>
      Whether it's over tea and biscuits with friends or lunchroom goss, we have
      all attempted to describe what either ourselves or another person is
      generally like. We are social animals that are motivated to understand how
      we are like all people, like some people, or like no other person,
      (Murray, and Kluckhohn, 1953).
    </p>

    <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
    <p>
      Personality traits are commonly used to describe personality. In
      psychology, a personality trait has a specific meaning (Haslam & Smilie,
      2022).

    <h3>Personality traits predict real world outcomes <span>🔮</span></h3>
    <p>
      Personality traits predict real-world outcomes with known accuracy,
      including academic success, job performance, and other important life
      outcomes. In today's modern world of fandangle gizmos and gadgets, it is
      not uncommon to hear phrases like "Instragram knows me too well”, this is
      because the footprints we leave especially on social media, can be used to
      profile our personalities, often used for tailoring services and content
      right to our preferences, so that we stay glued and coming back for more.
    </p>
    <img
      src="../assets/issue9/iphone.png"
      alt="personality tratis"
      class="img"
    />
    <p>
      For example, our behavioural patterns on social media are used to infer
      our personalities. People high in extraversion can be distinguished with
      ~70% accuracy, characterised by higher levels of activity and having a
      greater number of friends compared to most other people (Blackwell et al.,
      2017) . Individuals higher in the trait conscientiousness can be
      distinguished ~68% of the time, characterised by cautious management of
      their profiles, posting less and expressing fewer likes on other people's
      posts (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010), this study was published in
      2010; I would imagine it has been improved since then.

    <h2>Hypothetical example and common mishaps</h2>
      Franklin has just started playing tennis; his new peers describe him as
      sociable because his mouth does a lot of flapping. Frankfurt also
      frequents the church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend
      bird-watching seminars. However, Frankfurt is much quieter and far more
      reserved during his time at church and bird watching seminars. Because his
      talkativeness is observed only at the tennis club, it reflects situational
      exclusivity.

      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>No.</p>
      <h2>Myers-Briggs Nonsense Inventory</h2>
      I would not be surprised if you have taken something like the Myers-Briggs
      Nonsense Test (MBTI), an inventory that, when completed, outputs your
      personality type like ‘INTJ’ or ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBTI, I
      would suggest tossing it into the loo and be sure to use the FULL
      FLUSH setting, not the half flush setting. Personally, I would ensure my
      bladder was emptied prior to flushing.

      <h3>Figure: Myers Briggs Test Inventory</h3>

      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/myerbriggstoiletbowl.png"
        alt="myers briggs down the toilet bowl"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        If you are like me and have spent your spare time wondering how such
        waffle has turned into a US$2 billion personality assessment industry
        (Manne, 2014). A good starting point would be to investigate the
        authors, Katherine and Isobel Briggs, and the material that formed their
        logic. Neither Katherine nor Isobel had formal training in psychology or
        psychiatry; Katherine Briggs earned a college degree in agriculture, and
        her daughter Isobel was educated in drama. The pair, Briggs, dabbled in
        psychology during their spare time. Katherine was infatuated by
        the LEGENDARY Carl Jung, but also seemingly Carl Jung himself, writing
        poems and songs about his greatness.
      </p>
      <h3>Figure: The Briggs duo and Carl Jung</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/briggsjung.png"
        alt="briggslovesjung"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Carl Jung made many LANDMARK contributions to psychology, but his theory
        on personality types has been tossed in the garbage can by the academic
        community. When Jung himself is put under the microscope, it is clear
        that his past experiences shaped his view regarding binary personality
        types. A theorist's work is rarely uninfluenced by their own personality
        and life experiences (Wrightsman, 1994).
      </p>

      <p>
        Jung often sorted the world into vast dichotomies, black or white,
        positive or negative. Rarely did he describe anything as in-between or
        any shade of grey. young Jung saw himself as having two distinct
        personalities, personality 1, which he believed was known to his parents
        and others and personality 2, reserved for when tending to vital matters
        such as studying the mysteries of the universe” (Stolorow & Atwood,
        1979. P.98). With all of this the MBTI house is built upon straw and not
        solid stone.
      </p>
      <h2>Further evidence against personality types</h2>
      <p>
        Evidence against personality types can be found through studying large
        data sets of personality survey results that have accumulated over the
        years. If types existed, we would expect to see the survey results
        forming bimodal distributions – two distinct peaks that are clean cut,
        which would represent different personality types. E.g
      </p>

      <h3>Figure: Biomodal distribtion representing personality types</h3>

      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/biomodal.png"
        alt="biomodal camel"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        This is not what is seen, what is seen however is the forming of normal
        distributions. Where people express trait-related behaviours to degrees
        of difference along a continuum, with most people falling around the
        middle in relation to some trait x.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to Franklin, he is on average more introverted than extroverted,
        but he is completely void of extroversion, as he can be social and
        energetic. More accurately reflected using the dimensional approach. . .
      </p>

      <h3>Figure Franklins Hypothetical Extroversion Score</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/franklinextroversion.png"
        alt="frank extroversion"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        Note: When comparing Frankling to the results of a larger population he
        might appear on average a little less extroverted than the average
        person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evidence against personality types can be found in the reliability and
        validity metrics of the inventories used measure them. For example, a
        key reliability metric is the test-retest reliability, in the case of
        the nonsense Briggs, on one day it spits out oranges, and another day it
        labels you a banana, what good is that? Because we are interested in
        personality in general as it predicts things that matter, it would be
        good to have some sort of confidence in its predictive validity, and
        quite frankly, it's deplorable. There is a fair bit to reliability and
        validity, but I don’t want to put you to sleep. In short, the MBTI does
        not stack up to professional benchmarks. To end on a positive, I do
        commend Katherine and Isobel Briggs for their enthusiasm and go-getter
        spirit despite having no formal training, and it makes me wonder if they
        might have become hall of famers with some quality mentoring.
      </p>


    <h2>THE BIG 5 (OCEAN)🔥</h2>
    <p>
      The BIG 5 provides a structured hierarchy of personality traits. The
      high-level traits capture the five fundamental domains of individual
      differeneces. As you move down the hierarchy, the personality traits
      become more specific in definition, eventually leading to some kind of
      observable behaviour associated with the trait. Like you can move from a
      high-level trait to an observable behaviour, it is also possible to move
      bottom up from a specific instance to a broad level trait. For example, if
      you describe someone as Neurotic, it is very broad in definition and
      doesn't reveal much about what to expect. The use of a mid-level trait,
      such as nervous, would you a much better idea of what you might be in for
      if you bumped into this hypothetical person.

      <h2>BIG 5 History<span>📜</span></h2>
      The BIG 5 has been in work since 1936, and is the result of massive
      amounts of research that uses statistical methods such as clustering and
      factor analysis over many large datasets and seminal works. The BIG 5
      evolved on the basis of the lexical hypothesis, the idea that anything of
      value or important enough to a society is given a word and encoded in
      language
      <h2>Figure: BIG 5 key events</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/bigtimeline.png" alt="timeline" class="img" />

      <h2>Amazing Allport and Outstanding Odbert</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/allportodbert.png"
        alt="allportodbert"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        In 1936, Allport & Odbert dusted off a New International Dictionary and
        set out to extract all in search of words that described individual
        differences. Inclusion criteria for their list. Describes broad ways in
        which people can be different Describes temporary moods or activities.
        Describes social or character judgments of personal conduct.
        Descriptions of physique, mental capacities, and developmental
        conditions. Their easter egg hunt resulted in a list of 4,500 traits
        like impulsive, methodical, and sociable.
      </p>

      <h2>Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        Cattell used Allport's and Odbert's list of 4500 trait terms into 16
        fundamental personality factors using statistical methods like
        clustering and factor analysis. He published the 16PF inventory, which
        boasts strong test-retest reliability - Taking the test at time point
        one will yield scores ~85–94% similar if taken the same test again 2
        weeks later. The 16PF comes loaded with predictive validity, identifying
        quality leaders ~60–68% of the time (Conn et ., 1994). This isn't
        perfect, but it is still better than flipping a coin.
      </p>

      <h2>Legendary Lewis R. Goldberg</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/lewis.png" alt="lewis" class="img" />
      <p>
        Goldy in 1993 published "An alternative description of personality: The
        Big-Five factor structure" research showed across decades of psychology
        research the BIG 5 personality factors constantly emerged and BIG 5 was
        born.
      </p>

      <h2>Standardised Inventories</h2>

      Before wrapping it up, it wouldn't be right for me to soil on the
      Myers-Briggs Nonsense Inventory without providing alternatives. Common
      instruments include Cattell's 16PF, NEO-PI-R and the MMPI, which have
      undergone decades of research and testing and boast solid reliability and
      validity metrics. These tests have been completed by large populations of
      people, meaning that your results are compared to the established norms of
      most other people. . The MMPI, however, is reserved for qualified
      psychologists and psychiatrists because it is tailored for clinical
      assessment and high-risk occupational contexts. Some of its features
      include inbuilt mechanisms to catch fibsters, attempts to “fake good” and
      conversely “fake bad” , infrequent and random responses. For example, if
      someone has approached the questionnaire in a way that makes them appear
      more positive than they actually are, the MMPI can identify this. Because
      all the survey items have a known statistical relationship, correction can
      be applied, revealing a more accurate psychological profile of the person
      under test.
