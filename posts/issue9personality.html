    <h2>What is personality?</h2>
    <p>
      Personality ultimately sets out to describe individual differences
      regarding patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that remain
      relatively constant
      <b
        >across different environments, situations and over an extended period
        of time </b>, often spanning years and decades.
     
      (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
    </p>

    <h2>Why should we care about personality?</h2>
    <h3>1. Social Creatures</h3>
    <p>
      Discussions of personality can be traced back to the good old days of
      319BC, where Theophrastus pondered “Often before now have I applied my
      thoughts to the puzzling questions – why it is that, while all Greece lies
      under the same sky and all the Greeks are educated alike, It has befallen
      us to have characters so variously constituted”. Whether it be over tea
      and biscuits with friends or catching up on the latest gossip in the
      lunchroom, we have probably all attempted to describe our own or another
      person's fundamental tendencies. We are social animals that are motivated
      to understand how we are like all people, like some people, or like no
      other person, Murray, and Kluckhohn (1953).
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/issue9/potter.png" class="img" alt="potter" />
    <h3>2. Personality predicts real world outcomes</h3>
    <p>
      It is worth studying personality because personality predicts things that
      matter such as academic success, job performance and other important life
      outcomes to known levels of accuracy, at the group level. In a world
      dominated by modern gizmos and gadgets it is not uncommon to hear phrases
      like "Tik Tok knows me too well”, our digital footprints are used to
      profile our personalities often for the purposes of tailoring services and
      content smack bang to our preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, how we use social media can be used to infer our personality
      People high in extraversion can be distinguished ~70% of the time,
      characterized by beahaviours like higher levels of activity and have a
      greater number of friends (Blackwell et al., 2017) (Kosinski et al.,
      2014). People higher conscientiousness can be distinguish ~68% of the time
      characterised by more cautious management of their profiles, posting less
      and expressing less likes on other posts, (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky,
      2010).
    </p>

    <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
    <p>
      Personality traits are often used as the descriptive unit of personality.
      In psychology a personality trait is quite specific, (Haslam & Smilie,
      2022).

      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>No.</p>

      <b>Hypothetical example</b>
      Frankfurt’s has just starting playing tennis his new peers describe him as
      sociable because his mouth does a lot of flapping. Frankfurt also
      frequents church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend bird
      watching seminars. However, Frankfurt is much quieter and far more
      reserved at church and bird watching seminars. Because this talkativeness
      is restricted to the tennis club, it reflects situational exclusivity and
      there is not enough evidence regarding stability over a period of time, as
      Frank has only just started playing tennis. According to the type system
      Franklin would be put in the introvert bucket. In response to many decades
      of research and data collection, survey responses would plot to biomodal
      distrubitions. e.g. No people sitting inbetween either extrovert or
      introvert.
      <img src="../assets/issue9/frankbucket.png" class="img" alt="fanklin" />

      In reality the data forms a normal distribution in relation to a trait,
      where the central tendency, is where most people sit regarding their
      expressions of a trait.Frankfort expresses less behaviours related to
      extraversion when compared to a population, but none the less he does
      express it to some degree.
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/frankextroversion.png"
        class="img"
        alt="fanklin"
      />

      Frankfort might on average express more behaviours associated with
      introversion, when compared to a population of other people. Another
      disadvantage of the personality type theory is that their exist
      longitudinal studies that have shown that irrifutable evidence personality
      can change over a period of years and decades, however using the type
      system, the bucket you are assigned is what you get.

      />

      <h2>Myers Briggs Nonsense Inventory</h2>
      I would be unsuprised if you have taken something like the Myers-Briggs
      Nonsense Test (MBTI), an inventory that when completed outputs your
      personality type like ‘INTJ’ or ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBTI, I
      would suggest tossing it into the loo
      <span class="toilet-icon">&#128701;</span>
      and be sure to use the
      <b>FULL FLUSH</b> setting, not the half flush setting. Personally I would
      ensure my bladder was emptied prior to flushing. I also almost fell
      sideways when their wesbite told me it would cost me 85 bucks to do.

      <img

      />

      <p>
        If you are like me and have spent many hours of your spare time
        wondering how such waffle has turned into a US$2 billion personality
        assessment industry (Manne, 2014). A good starting point would be to
        investigate the authors Katherine and Isobel Briggs, who started working
        on it in the 1940s. Neither Katherine or Isobel had formal training in
        psycholgy or psychiatry, Katherine Briggs earned a college degree in
        Agriculture and her daughter Isobel was educated in Drama. Katherine
        dabbled in pscyhology in her spare time and was infatuated by the
        LEGENDARY Carl Jung, but also seemingly Carl Jung himself, who she wrote
        poems and songs about expressing how great he was. Carl Jung made many
        amazing contributions to psychology, but his theories on personality
        types must have been done on an off day. As we have put Katheriens and
        Isobel under the microscrope, we can learn more about Jung and how he
        conceptualized personality types. A theorist's work is influenced by
        their own personality and life experiences. (Adult personality book).
        Jung often softed the world into black or white, positive or negative,
        rarely any shade of grey. Young Jung saw himself as having two
        personalities, personality 1, which was known to his parents and others
        and personality 2 where he saw to vital matters such as studying the
        ultimate mysteries of the universe” (Stolorow & Atwood, 1979. P.98). A
        quick detour, Jungs mentor the SENSATIONAL Sigman Freuds theory on
        psychosexual development revolve around biological processes, his focus
        on biological explanations for personality development makes a lot more
        sense after learning he was a biologist, before moving into psychology
        topics. The entire MBTI stands on the idea of Carl Jungs personality
        types theories which long ago were tossed, questioning both Katherines
        and Isobels qualifications would be reasonable, personally I wouldn't
        get an accountant to do the plumbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strong evidence about personality types can also be found in the
        reliability and validity metrics of the invenotiries that measure them.
        For example, a key realiability metric is the test-retest reliability,
        in the case of the nonsense briggs, on one day its spits out oranges and
        taking another day can give you a bananas, what good is that. It would
        also be good to know something about what your personality type can
        predict in terms of real world outcomes through predictive validity, and
        quite frankly not a whole lot. There is a lot more regarding reliability
        and validity metrics, but I hope to keep you awake, in short the MBTI
        doesn't not come close meeting realiability and validity benchmarks for
        professional psychology. Ending on a positive note I commend both them
        for their enthusiasm and hard work, I imagine with a bit of formal
        training and high level montoring they could have gone down as hall of
        famers.

    <h2>THE BIG 5 (OCEAN)🔥</h2>
    <p>
      The BIG 5 provides a structured heirachy of personality traits. The
      Highest level traits describe the five core domains of individual
      differences, people differ in their own unique levels of expression, like
      we saw in the example of FRANKLIN. The BIG 5 is a structured hierachy
      starting with the 5 fundamental high level traits and becomes more
      specific in definition, eventually arriving at the final destination of
      some observable behaviour. The BIG 5 is the result of a lot of academic
      that began in 1936 and used methods like statiscal clustering and factor
      analysis. it is more common for people to use the mid level traits in
      general conversation, e.g. if you describe someone as the high level trait
      of Neurotic, id imagine the next question might be, in what way? A mid
      level trait such as, Tense Timmy gives you a much better idea on what to
      expect.

      <h2>BIG 5 History<span>📜</span></h2>

      <h2>Amazing Allport and Outstanding Odbert</h2>

        src="../assets/issue9/allportodbert.png"
        alt="allportodbert"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Allport & Odbert believed that anything of value or important enough to
        a society it would be included in language. . With this idea in 1936,
        they dusted off the New International Dictionary with the goal of
        extracting all adjectives that could describe ways in which people could
        be different individual differences. For a word to make it onto their
        list it had to meet to following inclusion criteria.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describes broad ways in which people can be different</li>
        <li>Describes temporary moods or activities.</li>
        <li>Describes social or character judgements of personal conduct.</li>
        <li>
          Describes of physique, mental capacities and developmental conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Out popped the small list of 4500 traits like impulisive, methodical and
      sociable + another 4597.

      <h2>Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        Like Allport & Odbert, Cattell supported the lexical hypothesis, but
        also hypothesised that personality traits correlate with real world
        outcomes. he was able to reduce Allports & Odberts list of 4500 trait
        into 16 fundamental personality factors using statistical methods like
        clustering and factor analysis. He invented the 16PF inventory which
        boasts strong test-retest realiability - similar scores about 85–94%
        over test taken 2 weeks apart. Studies like have shown it to be able to
        spo Based on predictive‑validity coefficients in thethe 16PF identifies
        leadership‑related abilities about 60–68% of the time (Conn, S. R., &
        Rieke, M. L. (1994)., which isn't perfect but it much better than
        flipping a coin.
      </p>

      <h2>Legendary Lewis R. Goldberg</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/lewis.png" alt="lewis" class="img" />
      <p>
        Goldy in 1993 published "An alternative description of personality: The
        Big-Five factor structure" research showed across decades of psychology
        research the BIG 5 personality factors constantly emerged, with the
        above studies being landmark findings of the time. The BIG 5 factors
        also holds up across cultures, with some minor differences culturally
        specific factors sometimes emerge e.g. using the same appraoch 'Harmony'
        arises in Chinese. But fundamentally the BIG 5 holds up acorss cultures.
      </p>

      <h2>Standardised Inventories</h2>

      Before wrapping it up, it wouldn't be right for me to soil on the Myers
      Briggs Nonsense Inventory without providing some far far more realiable
      and valid alternatives. THe following inventorie have undergone decades of
      research and testing and many come with built in mechanisms that catch out
      like fibsters, people faking to be better than they are, people faking to
      be worse than they are, infrequent respding and random responding. ALso
      because all questions on these surey are statistically related to one
      another if someone has approached the entire survey in a particualr way
      e.g trying to fake bad, a correction can be applied which would reveal a
      more accurate representation of them. As touched on Raymond Cattells 16PF
      boasts solid reliability and validity. NEO Personality Inventory NEO-PI-R
      is also famously used, and the MMPI is excellent but only used by
      professional pshychologist and psyciatrists because of its puse case which
      relates to clinical and screenings for high risk/ extreme environment
      related work. These inventories are built on the dimensional approach to
      personality. Another major benifit is a lot of people have completed them.
      Meaning that upon completion, your results are compared to a a massive
      data pool of other peoples results which form a normal distribution, this
      allows you or the test administrator to understand where somoone sits
      regarding some traits x in comparison to most other people. Results
      landing anywhere beyond 2 standard deviations away from the central
      tendency would be considered a consierable difference to most other

    Before wrapping it up, inventories are just one way of measuring personality
    there are a lot of other ways, they are just popular and can give you
    answers quickly and relitively cheaply.It is always good to keep in mind
    inventories are self-report and self-report evidence should form part of the
    evidence which contributes to a broader picture.
