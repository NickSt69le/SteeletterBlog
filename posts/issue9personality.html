          I trust you all had an <b>EXCEPTIONAL 2025</b> and have hit the ground
          running with a <b>THUMPING</b> start to <b>2026!</b> Today, I am over
          the moon to kick start the year with an electric piece on the topic of
          personality. Before getting stuck into todays psychological thriller I
          would advise sitting down with a good bit of popcorn and something to
          wash it down with. As always I have included bonus extracurricular
          material for the avid pupil. The <b>MultipleSTEELE Test </b> is
          located in Appendex A. If completed please message me your answers, I
          will mark them personally and provide tailored feedback.

        <h2>What is personality?</h2>
        <p>
          Personality refers to individual differences in thinking, feeling, and
          behaving that remain relatively stable over an extended period of time
          and are
          <b> consistent across different environments and situations</b>,
          (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
        </p>

        <h2>Why should we be fussed about personality?</h2>
        <p>
          Topics around personality have taken place, back in 319 BC the
          tremendous Theophrastus pondered “Often before now have I applied my
          thoughts to the puzzling questions – why it is that , while all Greece
          lies under the same sky and all the Greeks are educated alike, It has
          befallen us to have characters so variously constituted”. Whether it
          be over tea and biscuits with friends or catching up on the latest
          gossip with work colleagues in the lunchroom, we have probably all
          attempted to describe our own or another person's fundamental
          tendencies. We are social animals that are motivated to understand how
          we are like all people, like some people, or like no other person,
          Murray, and Kluckhohn (1953).

        <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
        <p>
