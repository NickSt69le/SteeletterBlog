      <h2>Part 1</h2>
      <h2>What is personality?</h2>
      <p>
        Personality refers to individual differences in thinking, feeling, and
        behaving that remain relatively stable over an extended period of time
        and are
        <b> consistent across different environments and situations</b>
        (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
      </p>
      <h2>Why should we care about personality?</h2>
      <p>
        Discussion of personality can dominate our daily conversations and has
        done so since 319 BC in which the tremendous Theophrastus pondered
        “Often before now have I applied my thoughts to the puzzling questions –
        why it is that , while all Greece lies under the same sky and all the
        Greeks are educated alike, It has befallen us to have characters so
        variously constituted”. Whether it be over tea and biscuits with friends
        or catching up on the latest gossip with work colleagues in the
        lunchroom, we have probably all attempted to describe our own or another
        person's fundamental tendencies. We are social animals that are
        motivated to understand how we are like all people, like some people, or
        like no other person, Murray, and Kluckhohn (1953).
      </p>

      <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
      <p>
        Personality traits are often used as the descriptive unit of
        personality. In psychology a personality trait is quite specific and
        must follow a few rules (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).

      <h2>Describing personality, a common mishap.</h2>
      <p>
        Frankfurt’s tennis peers describe him as sociable because his mouth does
        triple the amount of flapping at the tennis club. Frankfurt also
        frequents church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend bird
        watching seminar. However Frankfurt is much quieter and reserved at
        church and birdwatching. Because this talkativeness appears only around
        the tennis club, it reflects situational exclusivity and does not hold
        up to the across-environments test.

      <h2>Part 2</h2>
      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>
        No. You might have taken something like the Myers-Briggs Nonsense Test,
        an inventory that claims to spit out a personality type like ‘INTJ’ or
        ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBBI, I would suggest tossing in into the
        loo and be sure to use the <b>FULL FLUSH</b> setting, not the half flush
        setting, very important. Personally, I would also ensure my bladder was
        emptied prior to flushing.

      <h2>Amazing Allport and Outstanding Odbert</h2>

        src="../assets/issue9/allportodbert.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Allport & Odbert believed that anything of value to a society is 
        enoded in the language, this idea gave birth to the lexical hypothesis.
        Allport & Oddy went on to search the Websters New Internation Dictionary
        in search of trait terms that met the following criteria, (Allport & Odbert, 1936). 
        
        or terms that could
        describe individual differences 
     

      <ul>
        <li>Adjective that describes broad ways in which people can be different</li>
        <li>Adjective that describes temporary moods or activities.</li>
        <li>
          Adjective that describes social or character judgements of personal conduct.
        </li>
        <li>
         Adjectiveinclude Miscellaneous descriptions of physique, capacities, and developmental
          conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    Out popped the small list of 17 953 trait terms that described ways
      people could be different Some including traits like, impulisive,
      methodical and sociable. . .

  
      <h2>Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"/>
            </p>
     
      <p> Cattell also believed aspects of human personality are important have been rcorded in 
        langugae, but went on to hypothesise that traits can precide real world outcomes 
        like job success (Cattell, R.B, 1943). 

        Through using vaguely the following steps the 16PF was born. 
        Step 1: Sort 17 953 trait terms into clusters of synonyms and antonyms
        Step 2: Matched synonyms with antonyms
        Step 3: Got 100 people to rate 2 other people they know on a scale regarding 
        a trait. 
        Step 4: examined the correlations between words e.g. people who rated someone 
        else as warm also had high positive correlation with another trait term like kind. 
        Conversely, the antonyms had a high negative correlation with its antonym
        if someone was rated as warm, it was high likely this had a high negative 
        correlation with an antoymn like cold.
        Step 5: 16PF that describe core individual differences, that 
        comes with known predictive, construct and test-retest reliability metrics.
