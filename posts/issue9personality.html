      <h2>Part 1</h2>
      <h2>What is personality?</h2>
      <p>
        Personality refers to individual differences in thinking, feeling, and
        behaving that are relatively stable over a long period of time and
        remain
        <b> consistent across different environments and situations</b>
        (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
      </p>
      <h2>Why should we care about personality?</h2>
      <p>
        Among the first documented musing around persaonlity can be traced back
        to Theophrastus in 319 BC, “Often before now have I applied my thoughts
        to the puzzling questions – why it is that, while all Greece lies under
        the same sky and all the Greeks are educated alike, It has befallen us
        to have characters so variously constituted”. Whether it be over tea and
        biscuits with friends or catching up on the latest gossip in the
        lunchroom, we have probably all attempted to describe our own or another
        person's fundamental tendencies. We are social animals that are
        motivated to understand how we are like all people, like some people, or
        like no other person, Murray, and Kluckhohn (1953).
      </p>

      <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
      <p>
        Personality traits are often used as the descriptive unit of
        personality. In psychology a personality trait is quite specific and
        must follow a few rules (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).

      <h2>Hypothetical example</h2>
      <p>
        Frankfurt’s has just starting playing tennis his new peers describe him
        as sociable because his mouth does a lot of flapping. Frankfurt also
        frequents church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend bird
        watching seminars. However, Frankfurt is much quieter and reserved at
        church and bird watching. Because this talkativeness is restricted to
        the tennis club, it reflects both situational exclusivity and there is
        not enough evidence regarding stability over a period of time, as Frank
        has only just started playing tennis.

      <h2>Part 2</h2>
      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>
        No.I would be unsuprised if you have taken something like the
        Myers-Briggs Nonsense Test (MBTI), an inventory that outputs your
        personality type like ‘INTJ’ or ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBTI, I
        would suggest tossing in into the loo and be sure to use the
        <b>FULL FLUSH</b> setting, not the half flush setting. The acadmic
        evidence provides evidence for "individuals differing from one another
        by degrees rather than belonging to discrete categories (Haslam, Smilie,
        2022).

      <h2>BIG 5 (OCEAN)</h2>
      <p>
        The big 5 is an structured heirachy of personality traits that have
        evolved since 1936 using methods like statistical clustering and factor
        analysis. The big 5 are the fundamental domains that summarise
        individual differences. high level traits mid level, fijdisfjdis which
        eventually at the bottom drills down into some kind of observable
        behvariour.

    <article>
      <h2>How did we get to the BIG 5 (OCEAN)</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/bigtimeline.png" alt="timeline" class="img" />

      <h2>Amazing Allport and Outstanding Odbert</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/allportodbert.png"
        alt="allportodbert"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Allport & Odbert believed that anything of value or important enough to
        a society is encoded in the language. In 1936 the boys took a New
        International Dictionary in search of an extensive list of possible
        adjectives that could be used to describe individual differences. The
        criteria to make it on there list was as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adjective that describes broad ways in which people can be different
        </li>
        <li>Adjective that describes temporary moods or activities.</li>
        <li>
          Adjective that describes social or character judgements of personal
          conduct.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjectiveinclude Miscellaneous descriptions of physique, capacities,
          and developmental conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Out popped the small list of 17,953 traits like impulisive, methodical and
      sociable + another 17,950 that go to a similar tune.

      <h2>Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        Cattell believed in the lexical hypothesis, but explored how traits
        could be used to predict real world outcomes like professional job
        success (Cattell, R.B, 1943). Through roughly the following steps the
        16PF was born. Step 1: Sort 17 953 trait terms into clusters of synonyms
        and antonyms Step 2: Matched synonyms with antonyms Step 3: Got 100
        people to rate 2 other people they know on a scale regarding a trait.
        Step 4: examined the correlations between words e.g. people who rated
        someone else as warm also had high positive correlation with another
        trait term like kind. Conversely, the antonyms had a high negative
        correlation with its antonym if someone was rated as warm, it was high
        likely this had a high negative correlation with an antoymn like cold.
        Step 5: 16PF that describe core individual differences, that comes with
        known predictive, construct and test-retest reliability metrics.
      </p>

      <h2>Legendary Lewis R. Goldberg</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/lewis.png" alt="lewis" class="img" />
      <p>
        Formally coined the term BIG 5, refering to OCEAN traits after his
        research showed that the psychological literature agreed that the BIG 5
        were common stable factors that kept emerging in the psychological
        literature even across languages. and officially coined the big 5 in his
        famous paper Goldberg, L. R. (1993). An alternative “description of
        personality”: The Big-Five factor structure. Journal of Personality and
        Social Psychology, 59(6), 1216–1229. they used the psycholgocal
        literature and lexical datasets originating from allport and odbert to
        statistically derive the BIG 5 personality factors.
      </p>

      <h2>Standardised Inventories</h2>
      With all the research that has lead the BIG 5 into, we have starndarised
      inventories with known reliability and validity metrics. These are the
      better options because they are built on academic methods like the lexical
      hypothesis and statistical clustering and factor analysis.This
      d=dimensional appraoch to personality has reliable and valid inventories
      anlike the type appraoch which only has nonsense inventories which despite
      are popularly THAT IS ALL I HAVE FOR TODAY UNLESS YOU ARE AN AVID PUPIL in
      that case please find the MultipleSTEELE test to help consolidate your
      knowledge and improve memory retention of vital STEELETER syllabus. THANK
      YOU VERY MUCH FOR TUNING IN.
