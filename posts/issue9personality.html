      <h2>Part 1</h2>
      <h2>What is personality?</h2>
      <p>
        Personality refers to individual differences in thinking, feeling, and
        behaving that are relatively stable over a long period of time and
        remain
        <b> consistent across different environments and situations</b>
        (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).
      </p>
      <h2>Why should we care about personality?</h2>
      <p>
        Discussions around persaonlity can be traced back to the Tremendous
        Theophrastus in 319 BC, “Often before now have I applied my thoughts to
        the puzzling questions – why it is that, while all Greece lies under the
        same sky and all the Greeks are educated alike, It has befallen us to
        have characters so variously constituted”. Whether it be over tea and
        biscuits with friends or catching up on the latest gossip in the
        lunchroom, we have probably all attempted to describe our own or another
        person's fundamental tendencies. We are social animals that are
        motivated to understand how we are like all people, like some people, or
        like no other person, Murray, and Kluckhohn (1953).
      </p>

      <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
      <p>
        Personality traits are often used as the descriptive unit of
        personality. In psychology a personality trait is quite specific and
        must follow a few rules (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).

      <h2>Hypothetical example</h2>
      <p>
        Frankfurt’s has just starting playing tennis his new peers describe him
        as sociable because his mouth does a lot of flapping. Frankfurt also
        frequents church for gospel studies and the countryside to attend bird
        watching seminars. However, Frankfurt is much quieter and reserved at
        church and bird watching. Because this talkativeness is restricted to
        the tennis club, it reflects both situational exclusivity and there is
        not enough evidence regarding stability over a period of time, as Frank
        has only just started playing tennis.

      <h2>Part 2</h2>
      <h2>Do you have a personality type?</h2>
      <p>
        No.I would be unsuprised if you have taken something like the
        Myers-Briggs Nonsense Test (MBTI), an inventory that outputs your
        personality type like ‘INTJ’ or ‘BSBS’. If instructed to do an MBTI, I
        would suggest tossing in into the loo
        <span class="toilet-icon">&#128701;</span>
        and be sure to use the
        <b>FULL FLUSH</b> setting, not the half flush setting. Personally I
        would ensure my bladder is emptied prior to flushing, but i'll leave
        that up to your own personal autonomy.

        class="img"

      The psychological literature provides evidence for "individuals differing
      from one another by degrees rather than belonging to discrete categories
      (Haslam & Smilie, 2022).

      <h2>BIG 5 (OCEAN)</h2>
      <p>
        The big 5 is an structured heirachy of personality traits that have
        evolved since 1936 using methods like statistical clustering and factor
        analysis. The big 5 are the fundamental domains that summarise
        individual differences. high level traits mid level, which eventually at
        the bottom drills down into some kind of observable behvariour.

      <h2>How did we get to the BIG 5 (OCEAN)</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/bigtimeline.png" alt="timeline" class="img" />

      <h2>Amazing Allport and Outstanding Odbert</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/allportodbert.png"
        alt="allportodbert"
        class="img"
      />
      <p>
        Allport & Odbert believed that anything of value or important enough to
        a society is encoded in language. In 1936 the boys took a New
        International Dictionary in search of an extensive list of possible
        adjectives that could be used to describe individual differences. The
        criteria to make it on there list was as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describes broad ways in which people can be different</li>
        <li>Describes temporary moods or activities.</li>
        <li>Describes social or character judgements of personal conduct.</li>
        <li>
          Describes of physique, mental capacities and developmental conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Out popped the small list of 17,953 traits like impulisive, methodical and
      sociable + another 17,950 of a similar tune.

      <h2>Remarkable Raymond Cattell</h2>
      <img
        src="../assets/issue9/raymond.png"
        alt="raymond cattell"
        class="img"
      />

      <p>
        Like Allport & Odbert, Cattell supported the lexical hypothesis, but
        also hypothesised that personality traits correlate with real world
        outcomes. he was able to reduce Allports & Odberts list of 17, 953 trait
        into 16 fundamental personality factors using statistical methods like
        clustering and factor analysis.

      <h2>Legendary Lewis R. Goldberg</h2>
      <img src="../assets/issue9/lewis.png" alt="lewis" class="img" />
      <p>
        Goldy in 1993 published "An alternative description of personality: The
        Big-Five factor structure" research showed across decades of psychology
        research the BIG 5 personality factors constantly emerged, with the
        above studies being landmark findings of the time. The BIG 5 factors
        also holds up across cultures, with some minor differences culturally
        specific factors sometimes emerge e.g. using the same appraoch 'Harmony'
        arises in Chinese. But fundamentally the BIG 5 holds up acorss cultures.

      <h2>Standardised Inventories</h2>
      MMPI Norm refering your results are compared against a much larger
      representative distribution of other people who have also taken the MMPI.
      Plotting your results onto a normal distribution, The 2 standard deviation
      rule is commonly used, if you differ by 2 standard deviations on some
      trait x this would mean you display behaviours associated with a trait
      signficantly differently than most other people. for MMPI reliability and
      validity metrics https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9443642/
